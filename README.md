About

Looming is a term found in the study of perception. It refers to the rapid expansion in the size of any 
given image. As the image becomes increasingly large on the perceiver's retina, i.e., when an object looms, 
there is an automatic physiological response to perceive the object as an approaching object or surface, 
instead of one that is stationary or receding [1]. In the field of neurobiology and animal behaviour, a
looming stimulus is often used to simulate approach of a predator. Responding to looming stimuli is so
integral to an animal's survival in the wild that they do not habituate to repeated displays. It is therefore
used by biologists to understand perception, predator response, social interactions and information flow.

This code is an implementation of a looming stimulus that can be timed and displayed using an iOS devices. 
A video example is also presented where we see damselfish (_Dascyllus marginatus_) in the red sea retreating
into the coral head due to perceived threat of the loom.

The above code is written using C++11 and tested on MacOS Sierra 10.12.5. Running the code requires MacOS and
XCode to build. The grapics is done using Cinder 0.8.6. (https://libcinder.org/) a C++ library for creative coding.
